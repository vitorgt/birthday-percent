# Live Birthday Percentage

This project begun when I watched the TED Talk "[Inside the mind of a master procrastinator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU)" by Tim Urban and as a master procrastinator myself I got scared and wondered "How many weeks have I used? How many more are left until I'm 90 years old?"
